This new version of the 'Trace Mesurements' script for the Smartcard Lab needs 
to be run using a newer version of Matlab.

Before starting matlab in the command prompt type:

> module unload matlab/R2014a 

This will unload your current Matlab version (type matlab and then press the 
'tab' key if you don't know which version of matlab you are currently running)

> module load matlab/R20l4b

This will load the version that this script needs.

> matlab

Run matlab and then use the script as usual.
